{"name":"Moat-mobile","tagline":"Moat for mobile. Finally.","body":"# Moat Mobile\r\n\r\n## MoatJS, finally for mobile\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nThis is a very big excersize to demonstrate what Chrome installable apps are capable of.\r\n\r\nThis is an independently developed app by Gabriel Simmer. It uses an API created by me to fetch the data from Voat's legacy API, which will allow for future feature implementation.\r\n\r\n### Goal:\r\n\r\nBringing Voat.co to an easy-to-browse format for mobile phones and desktop apps.\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n**What features are there to implement?**\r\n\r\n*Plenty. First, subverse switching is on the list. Then I need to work on fetching self-posts, and finally I'll start working on implementing the shiny new API features.*\r\n\r\n**Why are you using the legacy API?**\r\n\r\n*I'm using the legacy API because the testing API is far too slow for production &\r\ntesting. However, when the new API get's pushed out I will be able to quickly\r\nupdate Moat.*\r\n\r\n**What can I help with?**\r\n\r\n*Testing. I need testers, especially on iOS and Windows Phone because I have access to neither types of device. I also need help with styling to make it better, and also a nicer icon.*\r\n\r\n**How can I install this on my phone?**\r\n\r\n*See below!*\r\n\r\n**Will this ever be a native app on `device`**?\r\n\r\n*No. The original plan would have included that, however I am now focusing Moat Mobile on being a much more Chrome Web App project. However, if you would like to use my man-in-the-middle server API for your own app, take a look into `js/GetStuff.js` (more info coming soon).*\r\n\r\n## Installing on your phone\r\n\r\nThe app requires an Internet connection to load content. I have not measured the\r\ndata impact of the app, so I recommend using only WiFi until I have some stats.\r\n\r\n- Visit http://gabrielsimmer.com/moat-mobile.\r\n\r\nAndroid:\r\n\r\n1.
