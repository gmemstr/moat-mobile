Finally.","body":"# Moat Mobile\r\n\r\n## MoatJS, finally for mobile\r\n\r\n### Goal:\r\n\r\nBringing Voat.co to an easy-to-browse format for mobile phones and desktop apps.\r\n\r\n### About\r\n\r\nThis is an independently developed app by Gabriel Simmer. It uses an API created\r\nby me to fetch the data from Voat's legacy API, which will allow for future\r\nfeature implementation.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n**Why are you using the legacy API?**\r\n\r\n*I'm using the legacy API because the testing API is far too slow for production &\r\ntesting. However, when the new API get's pushed out I will be able to quickly\r\nupdate Moat.*\r\n\r\n**What can I help with?**\r\n\r\n*Right now, I'm working on the basic styling of everything. However, I need help with\r\npackaging the app for mobile. When I compiled it using PhoneGap, it couldn't load the\r\ncontent from my API.*\r\n\r\n**How can I install this on my phone?**\r\n\r\n*Currently, the web app is not hosted online. It is expected to go online by the\r\nend of November. Then, you can follow the \"Installing on your phone\" guide.*\r\n\r\n### Installing on your phone\r\n\r\nThe app requires an Internet connection to load content. I have not measured the\r\ndata impact of the app, so I recommend using only WiFi until I have some stats.\r\n\r\n- Visit http://gabrielsimmer.com/moat-mobile (coming soon).\r\n\r\nAndroid:\r\n\r\n1.
