# Moat Mobile

## MoatJS, finally for mobile

## About

This is an independently developed app by Gabriel Simmer. It uses an API created
by me to fetch the data from Voat's legacy API, which will allow for future
feature implementation.

### Goal:

Bringing Voat.co to an easy-to-browse format for mobile phones and desktop apps.

## FAQ

**Why are you using the legacy API?**

*I'm using the legacy API because the testing API is far too slow for production &
testing. However, when the new API get's pushed out I will be able to quickly
update Moat.*

**What can I help with?**

*Right now, I'm working on the basic styling of everything. However, I need help with
packaging the app for mobile. When I compiled it using PhoneGap, it couldn't load the
content from my API.*

**How can I install this on my phone?**

*Currently, the web app is not hosted online. It is expected to go online by the
end of November. Then, you can follow the "Installing on your phone" guide.*

## Installing on your phone

The app requires an Internet connection to load content. I have not measured the
data impact of the app, so I recommend using only WiFi until I have some stats.
